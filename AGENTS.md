# Agents

This repo uses ten Claude Code subagents — seven surface specialists (rust-daemon, emacs-bridge, mac-app, ios-app, web-app, contract-keeper, release-conductor) and three meta agents (senior-reviewer, end-user, flow-validator) for cross-cutting audit and QA work.

Definitions live in `.claude/agents/<name>.md`. Each agent has its own tool allowlist, test invocation, and deploy authority. Generic Claude (no agent) is fine for one-off questions; when work touches code, pick a specialist.

## TL;DR

| Agent | Owns | Tests with | Deploy? | Invoke when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rust-daemon` | `daemon/` (7 crates) | `cargo test --workspace` | No | Parsing, indexing, agenda eval, HTTP routes, SSE, the Rust bridge client. |
| `emacs-bridge` | `elisp/` (eav.el + eav-bridge.el) | `ert` via batch emacs | No | New bridge methods, org-mode mutations, recursion-depth recovery. |
| `mac-app` | `apps/macos/` (shared + Mac-only) | `swift test`, `xcodebuild` | No | SwiftUI views, @Observable stores, EventKit, DaemonHost. |
| `ios-app` | iOS-only files under `apps/macos/EmacsAgendaViewer/Views/` + `App.swift` + `InlineRendererStub.swift` | `xcodebuild` + `devicectl` install | No | iOS NavigationStack/TabView/sheets, UIKit bridging, iPhone gestures. |
| `web-app` | `src/`, `tests/e2e/` | `tsc`, Playwright, `vite build` | No | React components, hooks, API client, Playwright. |
| `contract-keeper` | wire types in 4 files | rust dump + tsc + swift build | No | Adding/changing fields on `OrgTask` / `AgendaEntry` / `OrgTimestamp` / any eav-core type. |
| `release-conductor` | `deploy*.sh`, `scripts/install-daemon.sh`, CI, `CHANGELOG.org` | n/a — runs the deploy | **Yes** | Version bump, `./deploy.sh`, visa-nonsoe sync, GitHub release. |
| `senior-reviewer` | read-only audit of any surface | runs verifications (build/test) but never writes | No | Want a second pair of eyes before shipping; auditing a surface that's been moving fast. |
| `end-user` | read-only flow enumeration | none | No | Generate 10–20 plausible user journeys for QA / regression sweep planning. |
| `flow-validator` | read-only flow tracing | builds and inspects to validate | No | Given a flow from `end-user`, trace it against the code and report PASS/FAIL/RISK per step. |

## Decision tree

Start at the top, descend until one applies:

1. **Am I changing a field on a wire type** (`OrgTask`, `AgendaEntry`, `OrgTimestamp`, `OrgConfig`, `CaptureTemplate`, `TodoKeywords`, `AgendaFile`, `HeadingNotes`, `RefileTarget`, or any type defined in `daemon/crates/eav-core/`)?
   → **contract-keeper FIRST.** It updates the four mirrored files atomically. After it lands, downstream specialists handle business logic in parallel.

2. **Am I shipping** (version bump, `./deploy.sh`, GH release, restarting daemons on visa-nonsoe)?
   → **release-conductor only.** It has ssh and launchctl/brew authority; specialists don't.

3. **Otherwise**: pick the surface specialist whose path I'm editing.
   - Files under `daemon/` → `rust-daemon`.
   - Files under `elisp/` → `emacs-bridge`.
   - Files under `apps/macos/` → `mac-app`.
   - Files under `src/`, `tests/e2e/`, `vite.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `package.json` → `web-app`.

If multiple specialists are needed (e.g. new bridge method + Rust client + UI), invoke them in parallel **after** contract-keeper has landed any wire change.

## Worked examples

### 1. Single-surface — "Add tag editing on the row context menu"

The API (`PATCH /api/tasks/:id/tags`) already exists. No wire change.

→ Invoke `web-app` with the task. It adds a tag picker in `TaskItem.tsx`, wires to `setTags()` in `src/api/tasks.ts`, runs `tsc --noEmit` + `playwright test tests/e2e/tag-editing.spec.ts`, builds, reports.

### 2. Cross-surface — "Add a `pinned` boolean to tasks"

The field doesn't exist anywhere yet. Wire change.

1. `contract-keeper` ← "Add `pinned: bool` to OrgTask, default false." It edits:
   - `daemon/crates/eav-core/src/lib.rs` (`pub pinned: bool`)
   - `apps/macos/EmacsAgendaViewer/Models/Models.swift` (`var pinned: Bool`)
   - `src/types.ts` (`pinned: boolean;`)
   - `elisp/eav.el` JSON encoder for tasks (`(cons 'pinned (...))`)
   - Verifies with `cargo build`, `tsc --noEmit`, `swift build`, `curl /api/tasks | jq '.[0].pinned'`.
2. **Then in parallel:**
   - `emacs-bridge` ← "Add `write.set-pinned` bridge method that sets a `:PINNED:` property."
   - `rust-daemon` ← "Add `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/pinned` route that calls the new bridge method, and have eav-parse populate `pinned` from `:PINNED:`."
   - `web-app` ← "Add a pin icon button on the task row, calls `setPinned()`."
   - `mac-app` ← "Add a pin context-menu action on `MacTaskRow`."
3. Once all green: `release-conductor` ← "Cut v0.5.1."

### 3. Release — "Cut 0.5.0"

→ `release-conductor` only. It:
- Verifies all specialists' tests are green.
- Bumps `daemon/Cargo.toml` + `apps/macos/project.yml` to `0.5.0`.
- Updates `CHANGELOG.org`.
- Runs `./deploy.sh` (local + visa-nonsoe).
- `curl /api/debug` on both targets.
- `git tag v0.5.0 && git push --tags`.
- `gh release create v0.5.0` with CHANGELOG section.

## Memory dependencies

Each agent's system prompt cites entries from the user's auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-hermitsage-Github-Emacs-Agenda-Viewer/memory/`. If you rename or delete a memory file, update the corresponding agent prompt to match.

| Agent | Cites memory |
|---|---|
| `rust-daemon` | (none specific — uses general project knowledge) |
| `emacs-bridge` | `feedback_use_org_apis.md` (must delegate to org APIs, never reimplement) |
| `mac-app` | (none specific) |
| `web-app` | (none specific) |
| `contract-keeper` | `feedback_no_claude_coauthor.md` (commit trailer) |
| `release-conductor` | `feedback_brew_services.md` (prefer brew services), `reference_visa_nonsoe.md` (remote layout), `feedback_no_claude_coauthor.md` |

All agents that produce commits honor `feedback_no_claude_coauthor.md` — no `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer (a hook blocks them).

## Boundaries (what no agent does)

- **No "diagnostic doctor" agent.** Cold-boot debugging (stale bridge socket, recursion-depth deadlock, launchd quirks) is handled ad-hoc by `emacs-bridge` + `release-conductor`. The diagnostic flow doesn't reuse enough between incidents to justify its own definition.
- **No split inside `rust-daemon`.** The 7 crates form one Cargo workspace; one agent reasons about the whole pipeline. Splitting into parser/server adds handoff overhead with no upside.
- **No split inside `mac-app`.** The @Observable state seam is too central to separate from views/networking.
- **Generic Claude is fine for** questions ("what does this code do?"), reviewing PRs, exploratory research, and anything that doesn't write code.

## Adding a new agent

1. Copy `.claude/agents/web-app.md` as a template (it has all the standard sections).
2. Fill in: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `Scope`, `Test invocations`, `Build authority`, `Contract boundary`, `Known gotchas`, `Commit style`, `Reporting`.
3. Add a row to the TL;DR table above and a line to "Memory dependencies" if applicable.
4. Smoke-test with one trivial prompt before relying on it.

Keep the agent count small. Six is a working set the user can hold in their head; ten would not be. The bar for a new agent is "this work is meaningfully different from any existing surface AND will recur often enough that the per-agent context is worth maintaining."
